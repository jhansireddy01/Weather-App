# Weather-App- will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
